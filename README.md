# Blood Cancer using FractalsBlood Cancer using Fractals

## Description :

Application of fractal geometry and fractal dimensions 
in classification of blood cancer detection. 
I have used open image dataset of blood cancer 
tissues and applied sone image processing and calculated the Fractal 
Dimension of each images. And after analyzing the scatter plot of the fractal 
dimension Iâ€™ve trained the machine learning model to classify it and gained 
the 90% accuracy. 

Method used in Fractal Dimension Calculations is Box Counting Method which is quite easy to 
utilize on images.
